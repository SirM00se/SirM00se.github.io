<h2> 08/29/2025 Research Study </h2>
<br>
<p> I recently finished editing my research study, and it is now ready for submission for review. For anyone interested, here is my abstract: </p>
<p> Injuries are very common in baseball; however, there is not very much research regarding
    injuries among hitters. Furthermore, many past studies only look at the impact of injury on performance instead of value.
    This study aims to begin preliminary research of the impact of injuries on hitting value. This paper will achieve this by determining
    the impact the most commonly injured body parts have on hitting value in terms of Wins Above Replacement between 2014 and 2024 in the MLB.
    To accomplish this, a python program will gather all players with a major injury during this time period, and weighted on-base average values (wOBA)
    from 2 years before and after injury were generated for each player. These values were analyzed to find the significance of the difference from before
    and after injury. This average difference was quantified through wOBA, Cohen's D, and weighted runs above average (wRAA) to contextualize the findings.
    This study found that ankle/foot injuries have no significant difference; shoulder, knee, and back injuries have a small significant difference of
    around 7.11, 7.71, and 8.35 runs each; and hand/wrist injuries have a medium significant difference of around 12.55 runs.
    The quantification in terms of runs is a more useful form of data for MLB general managers which is new to the field.
    The impact in terms of value could be helpful toward contract negotiations because it is often unclear how a player’s value will change after
    injury without the use of statistics. </p>
